The Purpose of Contact Tracing

Contact tracing is a way to identify people who may have COVID-19 so they can avoid spreading it to others. It helps us track and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Contact tracing starts with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. This person will be advised to stay home except to get medical care until they are no longer
contagious. A trained interviewer will reach out to the person who has tested positive and ask for the contact information of close contacts. 
They will not ask for a social security number or about immigration status. Participation is voluntary. If a contact tests positive, the process starts over again 
as a confirmed case. If a contact shows no symptoms for 14 days, they can return to normal activities. If an infected contact is missed, the virus may spread to 
new contacts. Contacts stay home to watch for symptoms for 14 days after they were exposed.  Effective contact tracing depends on everyone’s participation. 
If public health calls you, we hope you’ll answer. If there were no contacts, the process stops. Confirmed case Confirmed case A close contact is a person who has
been within 6 feet, for 15 minutes or more, of someone who tested positive for COVID-19.


I do not feel that contact tracing is useful because of the following reasons below:


Tracking in general is an intrusive practice ▪ 
Tracking children is specifically intrusive and often can be inappropriate 
 Lack of trust by those being traced/tracked 
 Difficult to achieve 100% compliance 
 Inaccurate data
  Cultural differences may lead to lack of participation 
 People that lie or do not report or attempt to bypass the system 
 Lack of consequences for not complying. Without a consequence it becomes ineffective. Student’s can not be denied an education.
