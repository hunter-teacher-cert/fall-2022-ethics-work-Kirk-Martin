An algorithm to book passenger seating should have the following checks :

The algorithm would check to see the amount of tickets purchased at one time by a couple or family.
Check the Last name of passengers
Check the age of the passengers.
Check the time the tickets were purchased.
This would be important to note that if multiple tickets purchased at one time and tickets which passengers have the same family name would have the hughes priority in having their seating close to one another, You wouldn't want a situation where a married couple or person in a relationship are distanced from each other on the same flight. In regards to families you do not want children separated from their parents by seating. This would have the highest priority due to the fact that children would need supervision. This being the case the algorithm should check for the purchase time of tickets, the last name and ages of the passengers for the flight.

Checking the time frame in which tickets were purchased would influence the decision of where passengers are seated. You would assume that a family would not book a last minute flight . It may be individuals who for business purposes or last minute events would book last minute seats. If it is a priority for them to be in a certain section or near each other, paying extra, though not fair, should be understandable.
